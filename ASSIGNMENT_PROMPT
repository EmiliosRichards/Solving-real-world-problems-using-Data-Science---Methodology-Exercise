## **Solving Real-World Problems Using Data Science**

### **Prompt 1: Topic Selection**
**Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to?** *(2 points)*

---

### **Prompt 2: Business Understanding**
You will play the role of both the **client** and the **data scientist**.

Using the topic you selected, complete the **Business Understanding** stage by coming up with a problem you would like to solve. Then, phrase it as a question that you will use data to answer. *(3 points)*

You are required to:
- **Describe the problem** related to the topic you selected.
- **Phrase the problem as a question** that can be answered using data.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**
For a food recipes dataset, a possible question would be: *"Can we automatically determine the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients?"*

### **Prompt 3: Data Science Methodology Application**
For the problem described in the **Business Understanding** stage, briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages to ultimately answer the question you came up with. *(5 points)*

#### **Required Stages:**
1. **Analytic Approach** â€“ Define the analytical approach and what type of model is needed.
2. **Data Requirements** â€“ Identify the data needed, including content, format, and sources.
3. **Data Collection** â€“ Describe how and from where data will be collected.
4. **Data Understanding and Preparation** â€“ Explain steps for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
5. **Modeling and Evaluation** â€“ Detail the machine learning models used and how they will be evaluated.

ðŸ“Œ **Reference:** You can refer to the labs for examples on describing these stages.
